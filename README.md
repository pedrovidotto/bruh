# 6-Day Bro Split Routine Webapp

Static webapp with:
- `index.html` — markup and modal structure
- `styles.css` — theme and responsive styles
- `script.js` — data, DOM rendering, localStorage progress

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click the day buttons to view workouts.
3. Mark exercises complete — progress is saved to `localStorage`.
4. Use the Reset button to clear weekly progress.

## Notes & ideas
- Add icons, animations or export/import progress.
- Improve accessibility (focus traps in modals).
- Convert to a SPA framework (React/Vue) if you want persistence across devices.
